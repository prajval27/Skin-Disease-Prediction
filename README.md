Skin Disease Detection
In .ipynb model is created using keras and then it's weights used in web apllication which implemented using flask in app.py Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. Skin diseases may be caused by fungal infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. The advancement of lasers and Photonics based medical technology has made it possible to diagnose the skin diseases much more quickly and accurately. But the cost of such diagnosis is still limited and very expensive. So, image processing techniques help to build automated screening system for dermatology at an initial stage. The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases. Computer vision has a role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. This work contributes in the research of skin disease detection. We proposed an image processing-based method to detect skin diseases. This method takes the digital image of disease effect skin area, then use image analysis to identify the type of disease. I proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment other than a camera and a computer or a phone.
